# Phantom Aficionado Client

Client for the [Phantom Aficionado Server](https://github.com/UnsnugHero/Phan-Server).

This is an fan creation of the Phantom Aficionado Website (or Phansite) from the game <i>Persona 5</i>. The website from the game allows users to submit requests to the Phantom Thieves to fight crime and 'change the hearts' of criminals committing those crimes so that they don't continue committing crime. This project is not fully fleshed out, but many core features have been implemented such as submitting requests, creating an account/logging in, and anonymous chat.

The live site can be viewed [here](https://p5phansite.com).
