# TODO

- Change how form field errors are handled. For example, we want the 'Field is required' error to show when a user hits submit and has not entered an input to an input that is required. As of right now, it will only go away when submit it hit, but it should go away if the user types something into that input. This is low priority at the moment.
- hover over color change for buttons?

- style footer, try either same color as header, or a white/red separating line that is cut off on both sides almost reaching the ends of the left and right side of the page, and the link go under the line. there should be three sections, about, other stuff, more stuff. only links will be under about
- make a normal link that is red and becomes white on hover, make a footer link that gets underlined on hover but is otherwise white
