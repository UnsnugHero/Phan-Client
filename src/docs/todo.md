# TODO

- Change how form field errors are handled. For example, we want the 'Field is required' error to show when a user hits submit and has not entered an input to an input that is required. As of right now, it will only go away when submit it hit, but it should go away if the user types something into that input. This is low priority at the moment.
- hover over color change for buttons?

- sticky footer to bottom of page
- style footer
- make a normal link that is red and becomes white on hover, make a footer link that gets underlined on hover but is otherwise white
